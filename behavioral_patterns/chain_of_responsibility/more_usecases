Some of the practical scenarios of chain of responsibility are
1. Customer Support Escalation
Flow: Customer → Level 1 Agent → Level 2 Agent → Manager → Director.

2. ATM Cash Withdrawal
Flow: ATM → Check ₹2000 note availability → If not, check ₹500 note availability → If not, check ₹100 note availability.

3. Logging Frameworks
Flow: Log request → ConsoleLogger → FileLogger → DatabaseLogger.

4. Approval Processes in Companies
Flow: Expense request → Team Lead → Manager → Director → CFO.

5. Middleware in Web applications
Flow: Request → Authentication Middleware → Logging Middleware → Compression Middleware → Final Handler.

6. Exception Handling in Programming
Flow: Code throws an exception → First catch block checks → If not matched, next catch → Finally, global handler.

7. Event handling in GUIs
Flow: User clicks → Button → Panel → Window → Application.
